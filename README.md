Turkey Escape is a simple text-based game where the player takes on the role of a turkey trying to escape from a kitchen before becoming dinner for the holiday feast. The player must explore different rooms, collect items, and solve puzzles in order to find the keys to unlock the doors and escape the kitchen.


To play the game, simply run the TextBasedGame.py file in your Python environment. The game will start and prompt you with instructions on how to play.

Once you begin the game, you can use the commands "north", "east", "south", and "west" to move between rooms. If there is an item in the room, you can use the command "get" to pick it up.

Your goal is to find the two keys (one red and one blue) to unlock the metal doors and escape from the kitchen. Be careful though, as there are obstacles and challenges along the way.
