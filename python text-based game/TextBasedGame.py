Here is a bunch of if statements, I was unable to find a better way of writing this section of code.
during this week of 12/5/2022 -12/9/2022. I had to take care of my sisters babies, she was going in to labor, it was a 
challenge writing the code. later I hope I can find a better way to write this section of code.
This message is for future me and my instructor Ryan McArthur.
